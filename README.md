# Data Visualization and Dashboarding Training Repository

This repository provides a comprehensive guide for building skills in data visualization and dashboarding using Power BI and Tableau. It offers a structured approach to learning, with practical examples, tutorials, and projects covering essential and advanced topics.

## Skills and Learning Paths

### 1. Power BI
- **Data Connection and Transformation**
  - [ ] Connecting to various data sources (SQL, APIs, CSV, etc.)
  - **Example**: Connect Power BI to an SQL database and perform data transformations to clean and prepare data for analysis.
- **Data Modeling**
  - [ ] Creating relationships, calculated columns, and measures
  - **Example**: Build a star schema model to improve query performance and enable efficient reporting.
- **Visualization and Dashboarding**
  - [ ] Building interactive dashboards with slicers, filters, and visual interactions
  - **Example**: Create a dynamic sales dashboard that allows users to filter data by region, product, and time period.
- **Publishing and Sharing**
  - [ ] Publishing dashboards to Power BI Service and managing permissions
  - **Example**: Publish a dashboard to Power BI Service, set up scheduled refreshes, and share it with different user groups.

### 2. Tableau
- **Data Connection and Transformation**
  - [ ] Connecting to various data sources (SQL, APIs, CSV, etc.)
  - **Example**: Connect Tableau to a web API and use Tableau Prep to clean and shape the data before visualization.
- **Data Modeling**
  - [ ] Creating calculated fields, data blends, and joins
  - **Example**: Use data blending to combine data from multiple sources and create a unified view for analysis.
- **Visualization and Dashboarding**
  - [ ] Building interactive dashboards with parameters, filters, and dashboard actions
  - **Example**: Develop a dashboard that allows users to switch between different metrics using parameter controls.
- **Publishing and Sharing**
  - [ ] Publishing dashboards to Tableau Online/Public and embedding in web applications
  - **Example**: Publish a Tableau dashboard to Tableau Public and embed it into a corporate website for external users.

### 3. Advanced Data Visualization Techniques
- **Custom Visualizations**
  - [ ] Creating advanced visualizations like Sankey diagrams, radar charts, and custom maps
  - **Example**: Build a custom radar chart in Tableau to compare performance across multiple dimensions.
- **Storytelling with Data**
  - [ ] Using dashboards to tell compelling data stories
  - **Example**: Create a multi-step dashboard that guides the user through a narrative, highlighting key insights at each step.

### 4. Geospatial Analysis
- **Basic Mapping**
  - [ ] Visualizing data on geographic maps
  - **Example**: Plot customer locations on a map in Tableau and color-code them by sales volume.
- **Advanced Geospatial Techniques**
  - [ ] Performing spatial analysis, route optimization, and demographic studies
  - **Example**: Analyze travel times and optimize delivery routes using spatial data in Power BI.

### 5. Data Engineering (ETL) and Data Warehousing
- **ETL Processes**
  - [ ] Designing and implementing ETL pipelines using tools like SQL, Python, and data integration platforms
  - **Example**: Create an ETL pipeline that extracts data from multiple sources, transforms it for consistency, and loads it into a data warehouse.
- **Data Warehousing**
  - [ ] Designing data warehouses using star and snowflake schemas
  - **Example**: Set up a data warehouse to support analytical reporting for a retail company, focusing on sales and inventory data.

### 6. Performance Optimization
- **Dashboard Performance Tuning**
  - [ ] Optimizing dashboards for faster load times and better user experience
  - **Example**: Use Power BI's Performance Analyzer to identify bottlenecks and optimize visuals for better performance.
- **Data Modeling Best Practices**
  - [ ] Efficient querying and data storage techniques
  - **Example**: Implement best practices in data modeling to reduce data duplication and improve query efficiency.

### 7. Interactive and Dynamic Dashboards
- **Parameter-Driven Dashboards**
  - [ ] Creating dashboards that adapt to user inputs
  - **Example**: Build a sales performance dashboard in Tableau that allows users to select different time periods and product categories dynamically.

### 8. Certification Paths
- **Power BI Certification**
  - [ ] Preparing for Power BI certification exams with resources and practice tests
  - **Example**: Complete a series of exercises that mimic the Power BI certification exam format, covering data modeling, visualization, and DAX.
- **Tableau Certification**
  - [ ] Preparing for Tableau certification exams with resources and practice tests
  - **Example**: Work through practice scenarios that cover Tableau Desktop Specialist exam topics, including data connection, visualization, and dashboarding.
