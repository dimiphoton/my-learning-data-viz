# the task:

## in a nutshell
a dashoard for a supply chain 
# more precisely
A supermarket implements the machine learning based replenishment use-case discussed in the example in the
course book. Imagine that you, as a senior data scientist, are asked to design a dashboard for a supply chain expert
in charge of monitoring the automated replenishment system used across 100 stores in 10 countries. The
dashboard should allow the expert to monitor the current performance, highlight issues and indicate where a
manual intervention may be required.
